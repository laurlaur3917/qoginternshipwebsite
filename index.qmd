```{r}

I am adding this piece of code so can see how the interactive an non interactive plots can be embedded %>%  in quarto. You can erase it if you want. 

```{r}
library(highcharter)
highcharter::highcharts_demo()

```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(datasauRus)

datasauRus::datasaurus_dozen %>% 
  filter(dataset == "dino") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_void()

```
